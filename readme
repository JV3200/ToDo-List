# To-Do List Application Readme

This is a simple interactive To-Do List application written in JavaScript. It allows users to manage their to-do tasks by adding new tasks, viewing the current list, and deleting tasks based on their index.

## Getting Started

To use the To-Do List application, follow these steps:

1. Open your favorite web browser.
2. Create a new HTML file and add the following script to it:

```html
<script>
  // Place the JavaScript code provided in this script tag
</script>
```

3. Save the HTML file.
4. Open the HTML file in your web browser.

## Usage

Once you've opened the HTML file, a prompt will appear asking, "What would you like to do?". You can interact with the application by entering one of the following commands:

- `list`: Displays the current to-do list along with their respective index numbers.
- `new`: Adds a new task to the to-do list.
- `delete`: Deletes a task from the to-do list based on the index number provided.

### Examples

#### Listing Tasks

If you enter `list`, the application will display the current to-do list as follows:

```
0: collect mail
********
1: clean room
********
2: walk dog
********
```

#### Adding a New Task

If you enter `new`, the application will prompt you to enter the new to-do task. For example:

```
What is the new todo?
> Buy groceries
Buy groceries added to the list
```

#### Deleting a Task

If you enter `delete`, the application will prompt you to enter the index number of the task you want to delete. For example:

```
Ok, enter an index to delete!
> 1
Deleted todo clean room
```

## Exiting the Application

To exit the application, you can type either `quit` or `q` in response to the "What would you like to do?" prompt. Upon exiting, the application will display "Goodbye!" in the console.

## Note

Please note that this is a simple demonstration of a to-do list application and does not persist data between sessions. When you close the web page, the data will be reset.

Feel free to customize and expand this code to add more features and functionalities to suit your needs.

Happy organizing your to-do tasks!

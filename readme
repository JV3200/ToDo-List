# To-Do List Application Readme

This is a simple interactive To-Do List application written in JavaScript. It allows users to manage their to-do tasks by adding new tasks, viewing the current list, and deleting tasks based on their index.

## Getting Started

To use the To-Do List application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ToDoList.git
```

2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## Usage

Once you've opened the `index.html` file in your web browser, you will see the following interface:

```
ToDo List

- "new" - Add a ToDo
- "list" - List All ToDos
- "delete" - Remove Specific ToDo
- "quit" - Quit App
```

To interact with the application, simply type one of the provided commands (e.g., "new", "list", "delete", "quit") in the prompt that appears. The application will then perform the corresponding action based on your input.

### Examples

#### Listing Tasks

If you enter `list`, the application will display the current to-do list as follows:

```
0: collect mail
********
1: clean room
********
2: walk dog
********
```

#### Adding a New Task

If you enter `new`, the application will prompt you to enter the new to-do task. For example:

```
What is the new todo?
> Buy groceries
Buy groceries added to the list
```

#### Deleting a Task

If you enter `delete`, the application will prompt you to enter the index number of the task you want to delete. For example:

```
Ok, enter an index to delete!
> 1
Deleted todo clean room
```

## Exiting the Application

To exit the application, you can type either `quit` or `q` in response to the "What would you like to do?" prompt. Upon exiting, the application will display "Goodbye!" in the console.

## Note

Please note that this is a simple demonstration of a to-do list application and does not persist data between sessions. When you close the web page, the data will be reset.

Feel free to customize and expand this code to add more features and functionalities to suit your needs.

Happy organizing your to-do tasks!
